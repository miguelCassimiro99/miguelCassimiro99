### Hi there 👋

🙋‍♂️ Developer, UX Designer, gamer, cook and curious.

👔 Acting as a developer in a software house using tools like Nuxt.js and Laravel

👨‍🎓 Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development

💻 Training front-end, I have been studying technologies that allow me to evolve more and more in the area and contribute with my knowledge. Applied to this, I have been pursuing UX | UI studies seeking to unify this knowledge in order to deliver projects that meet the user's need and bring comfort in use.

✔ Participatory, collaborative and always able to listen and learn. I like to spend a lot of time listening to music, studying and also taking the time to challenge myself on projects to apply and consolidate knowledge.
In my spare time I love to cook, play all kinds of games and practice some outdoor activity.
